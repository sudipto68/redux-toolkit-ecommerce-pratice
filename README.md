This is a Demo E-commerce Web App. To show the main functionality of an Ecommerce Project with Redux Toolkit. I have used Fake Store API as a dummy API to get the products.

Till now:
1. User Can search or browse products and see the product detail page. 
2. Add product to cart and in the cart page increment and decrements products and also remove products from the cart.
3. Users can see suggested products on each product's detail page.
4. Wishlist functionality based on local storage.
5. Users can filter products by category.

I have not implemented any authentication for this project yet. I have used the Redux toolkit for state management purposes.

## Used Technology:

1. React Js
2. React Bootstrap
3. React Router (v6)
4. Redux Toolkit - for state management
5. React Toastify
6. React elastic carousel

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`
